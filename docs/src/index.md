## Overview

kim_api.jl provides both low-level and high-level interfaces to KIM-API, enabling Julia users to access the extensive collection of validated interatomic models available through the OpenKIM framework. Main purpose of this package is to provide a convenient way to integrate KIM models into Julia based MD simulators. Think of this as the Julia equivalent of the KIMPY package but with additional wrappers for ease of use.

### Features

- **High-level functional interface** with `KIMModel()`
- **Automatic species mapping** and validation
- **Default support for multiple unit systems** (metal, real, SI, CGS, atomic)
- **Memory-safe wrappers** around KIM-API C functions
- **Comprehensive error handling** and validation

### Quick Start

```julia
using kim_api

# Create a model function
model = kim_api.KIMModel("SW_StillingerWeber_1985_Si__MO_405512056662_006")

# Define atomic system
species = ["Si", "Si"]
positions = [SVector(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), SVector(2.7, 2.7, 2.7)]
cell = Matrix(5.43 * I(3))  # Silicon diamond structure
pbc = [true, true, true]

# Compute energy and forces
results = model(species, positions, cell, pbc)
println("Energy: $(results[:energy]) eV")
println("Forces: $(results[:forces])")
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You must have the KIM-API C++ library installed on your system. Visit [openkim.org](https://openkim.org) for detailed installation instructions.

Easiest way to install the KIM-API is Conda:

```bash
conda create -n kim-api kim-api=2.4 -c conda-forge
conda activate kim-api
export KIM_API_LIB=${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/libkim-api.so
```

### Package Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/ipcamit/kim_api.jl.git")
```

### Environment Setup

If KIM-API is not in your system library path, set the environment variable:

```bash
export KIM_API_LIB="/path/to/libkim-api.so"
```

## Supported Unit Systems

kim_api.jl supports multiple unit systems commonly used in molecular dynamics:

| System     | Length   | Energy     | Charge | Temperature | Time |
|------------|----------|------------|--------|-------------|------|
| `:metal`   | Ångström | eV         | e      | K           | ps   |
| `:real`    | Ångström | kcal/mol   | e      | K           | fs   |
| `:si`      | meter    | Joule      | C      | K           | s    |
| `:cgs`     | cm       | erg        | statC  | K           | s    |
| `:electron`| Bohr     | Hartree    | e      | K           | fs   |

You can also specify custom units by passing a named tuple of units during model creation:

```julia
custom_units = (length=kim_api.A, energy=kim_api.eV, time=kim_api.fs, charge=kim_api.e, temperature=kim_api.K)
model_custom = kim_api.KIMModel("SW_StillingerWeber_1985_Si__MO_405512056662_006", 
                                 units=custom_units)
```

## KIM Model Access

Visit [openkim.org](https://openkim.org) to browse the complete model database.

## Architecture

The package is organized into several modules:

- **`libkim.jl`**: KIM-API library loading and initialization
- **`constants.jl`**: KIM-API constants, enumerations, and unit systems
- **`model.jl`**: Low-level model creation and management
- **`species.jl`**: Species handling and validation
- **`neighborlist.jl`**: Neighbor list generation and callbacks
- **`highlevel.jl`**: High-level user interface

## Performance

kim_api.jl is designed for high performance:

- Pre-computed species mappings minimize lookup overhead
- Efficient neighbor list generation using NeighbourLists.jl
- Zero-copy data passing to KIM-API where possible
- Minimal Julia-C FFI overhead
- Automatic memory management prevents leaks
